The main page displays a list of products with the name, image and price. Each product can be immediately added to the basket, more than once.
At the top is a link to the page "Basket" with a counter of the quantity of goods ordered.

The page "Basket" displays a list of ordered products, sorted by the time of addition (the last added - at the top).
Products from the basket can be removed (one by one or all at once), as well as change the number of items ordered. At the bottom of the page displays the total amount of the order.
